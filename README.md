## This repository contains algorithm to solve the coding problems in JAVA

1) Remove Duplicate from Sorted array :: RemoveDuplicate.java 
   <p>Given an array of integer nums[] in increasing order.return the count of unique elements and modify array in place in such a way that first k elements are unique. </p>
   
2) Remove Given Element from array :: RemoveElement.java
   <p>Given an array of integer nums[] and integer val. shift all occurrence of val from nums[] in placec in such a way that first k elements are not equal to val.
     return the count of array elements which are not equal to val</p>  

3) Return the sum equal to target :: TwoSum.java
   <p>Given an array of integer nums[] and integer target. return the indices from array whose sum is equal to target.</p>
